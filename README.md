- **Code with Kiro Hackathon**: Educational Apps Category
- **GPT-OSS Hackathon**: For Humanity + Best Local Agent Categories

An revolutionary platform that combines Kiro's development workflow with GPT-OSS AI models to teach developers code review skills through interactive, AI-generated exercises.

## 🎯 The Problem

Code review is one of the most critical skills for senior developers, yet it's rarely taught systematically. Most developers learn through trial and error, missing crucial issues that could impact security, performance, and maintainability.

## 💡 The Solution

DevFlow gamifies code review learning by:
- Generating realistic code with intentional bugs and anti-patterns
- Providing interactive review interfaces with expert feedback
- Tracking skill development across different review categories
- Simulating real-world collaborative review scenarios

## 🚀 Revolutionary Features
