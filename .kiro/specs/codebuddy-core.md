# DevFlow: Code Review Training Platform Specification

## Overview
DevFlow is an innovative educational platform that teaches developers code review skills by having them review AI-generated code with intentional bugs, anti-patterns, and improvement opportunities.

## Target Users
- Junior developers (1-3 years experience) wanting to level up
- Bootcamp graduates preparing for senior roles
- Self-taught developers lacking code review experience
- Teams wanting to standardize review practices

## Core Features

### 1. Code Review Simulator
**Purpose**: Present flawed code for users to review and provide feedback
**Input**: User selects difficulty level and programming language
**Output**: Code snippet with intentional issues + review interface

**Requirements**:
- Generate code with realistic bugs (logic errors, performance issues, security flaws)
- Multiple issue types: syntax, logic, performance, security, style
- Interactive annotation system for marking issues
- Scoring system based on issues found vs missed
- Detailed explanations for each issue type

### 2. Review Skills Trainer
**Purpose**: Teach specific code review techniques and best practices
**Input**: Skill category (security, performance, readability, etc.)
**Output**: Targeted exercises with expert feedback

**Requirements**:
- Progressive skill building from basic to advanced
- Real-world scenarios (API endpoints, database queries, UI components)
- Expert commentary on review approaches
- Comparison with industry-standard review practices

### 3. Team Review Simulator
**Purpose**: Simulate collaborative code review process
**Features**:
- Multi-reviewer scenarios
- Conflict resolution exercises
- Communication style training
- Review etiquette and constructive feedback practice

### 4. Progress Analytics
**Purpose**: Track improvement in review skills over time
**Features**:
- Skill radar chart (security, performance, style, etc.)
- Issue detection accuracy trends
- Time-to-review metrics
- Personalized improvement recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Component-based UI with reusable elements
- State management for user progress
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Code editor integration (Monaco Editor)

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API endpoints
- SQLite database for user progress
- AI integration for code analysis
- Session management

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  skill_level TEXT DEFAULT 'beginner',
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Code review exercises
CREATE TABLE review_exercises (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  language TEXT,
  difficulty TEXT,
  code_content TEXT,
  issues_json TEXT, -- JSON array of intentional issues
  category TEXT, -- security, performance, style, logic
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User review attempts
CREATE TABLE review_attempts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER,
  exercise_id INTEGER,
  issues_found_json TEXT, -- JSON array of issues user identified
  review_comments TEXT,
  score INTEGER,
  time_spent INTEGER, -- seconds
  completed_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (exercise_id) REFERENCES review_exercises(id)
);

-- User skill progress
CREATE TABLE skill_progress (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER,
  skill_category TEXT, -- security, performance, style, logic
  accuracy_score REAL,
  exercises_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_updated DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up React frontend with TypeScript
2. Create Express backend with basic routing
3. Implement SQLite database connection
4. Set up development environment

### Phase 2: Code Explainer Feature
1. Create code input component with syntax highlighting
2. Implement AI-powered code analysis
3. Design explanation display with concept highlighting
4. Add support for multiple programming languages

### Phase 3: Practice Generator
1. Create exercise template system
2. Implement concept-based exercise generation
3. Add code editor for practice attempts
4. Create solution checking mechanism

### Phase 4: Learning Dashboard
1. Implement user progress tracking
2. Create dashboard UI components
3. Add achievement system
4. Design learning path recommendations

## Success Metrics
