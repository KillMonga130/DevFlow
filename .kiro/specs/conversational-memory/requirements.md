# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The conversational memory feature enables the system to maintain context and continuity across multiple interactions with users. This feature allows the system to remember previous conversations, user preferences, and contextual information to provide more personalized and coherent responses over time. The system will store, retrieve, and manage conversation history while respecting user privacy and data retention policies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our previous conversations, so that I don't have to repeat context and can have more natural, continuous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL retrieve and load the user's conversation history from the previous 30 days
2. WHEN a user references something from a previous conversation THEN the system SHALL be able to access and utilize that contextual information
3. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL maintain context from the current conversation thread
4. IF a conversation exceeds 50 exchanges THEN the system SHALL summarize older parts while maintaining recent context
###
 Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control what information is remembered about our conversations, so that I can maintain my privacy and data preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to delete conversation history THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all specified conversation data
2. WHEN a user marks information as sensitive THEN the system SHALL exclude that information from future memory retrieval
3. IF a user enables privacy mode THEN the system SHALL not store any conversation data beyond the current session
4. WHEN a user requests their conversation data THEN the system SHALL provide a complete export of their stored conversations### Re
quirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn my preferences and communication style, so that interactions become more personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user consistently prefers certain response formats THEN the system SHALL adapt its default response style accordingly
2. WHEN a user frequently discusses specific topics THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevant context for those subjects
3. IF a user corrects the system's assumptions THEN the system SHALL update its understanding and avoid similar mistakes
4. WHEN a user has established preferences THEN the system SHALL apply those preferences to new conversations### Req
uirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage conversation data storage and retention, so that the system operates efficiently and complies with data policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation data exceeds retention limits THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete old conversations according to policy
2. WHEN the system stores conversation data THEN it SHALL encrypt all stored information at rest
3. IF storage capacity approaches limits THEN the system SHALL compress or summarize older conversations to free space
4. WHEN accessing stored conversations THEN the system SHALL log all access attempts for audit purposes### Req
uirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversational memory to integrate seamlessly with the existing chat system, so that memory functionality works transparently without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory system is enabled THEN existing chat functionality SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN memory retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to standard conversation mode
3. IF memory data becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL isolate the corrupted data and continue operating with remaining valid data
4. WHEN the system processes a conversation THEN memory operations SHALL not introduce noticeable latency to response times#
## Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through my conversation history, so that I can quickly find specific information or topics we've discussed before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for keywords in their history THEN the system SHALL return relevant conversation excerpts with context
2. WHEN a user searches by date range THEN the system SHALL filter results to show only conversations from the specified timeframe
3. IF a search returns many results THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance and recency
4. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL highlight the matching terms and provide surrounding context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the conversational memory system to be resilient and maintainable, so that it can handle failures gracefully and provide reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service component fails THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
2. WHEN the system encounters edge cases or invalid inputs THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. IF floating point calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate precision handling to avoid comparison failures
4. WHEN service health is checked THEN all components SHALL report their status accurately for monitoring and debugging
