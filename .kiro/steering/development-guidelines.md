# DevFlow Development Guidelines

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Educational Focus
- Focus on realistic code review scenarios that developers encounter daily
- Provide detailed explanations for why issues matter (security, performance, maintainability)
- Use progressive difficulty to build confidence gradually
- Make feedback constructive and actionable, not just critical
- Simulate real-world collaborative review processes

## AI Integration
- Use AI to generate educational content, not replace learning
- Ensure AI explanations are accurate and beginner-appropriate
- Provide multiple explanation styles (visual, textual, step-by-step)

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize for fast loading on slower connections
- Implement proper caching for generated content
- Use lazy loading for non-critical components
- Keep bundle sizes minimal

## Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images and icons
- Maintain good color contrast ratios
##
 Code Review Best Practices
- Generate realistic flawed code that mirrors actual development mistakes
- Include multiple issue types per exercise (security, performance, style, logic)
- Provide context for why each issue matters in production environments
- Use industry-standard terminology and practices
- Include both obvious and subtle issues to challenge different skill levels

## User Experience Design
- Make the review interface intuitive and similar to real code review tools
- Provide immediate visual feedback when users identify issues
- Use color coding and icons to communicate severity levels clearly
- Enable easy navigation between code and review comments
- Show progress and improvement over time to maintain motivation

## Gamification Elements
- Award points and badges for consistent practice and improvement
- Track streaks and personal bests to encourage regular use
- Provide skill-specific progress tracking (security, performance, etc.)
- Create challenges and competitions to increase engagement
- Celebrate achievements and milestones meaningfully
